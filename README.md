# LULC-Classification
The purpose of this project is to conduct LULC classification from EuroSAT RGB dataset consisting of Sentinel-2 satellite images. Classical machine learning methods like XGB, RF and SVM as well as Artificial Neural Network like basic ANN and MLP are used in this project and compare the results. Furthermore deep learning algorithms like basic CNN, VGG16/19, ResNet50/101/152, Inception V1/V3, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNet, DenseNet121 and NASNetMobile are also used and analyze the results based on the high parameters.
